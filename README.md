A post-apocalyptic roleplaying game for pre-apocalyptic computers.

Developed in C language using CPCTelera (http://lronaldo.github.io/cpctelera/) for Amstrad Computers by @macarvajal.
maybe he is a contestant in the forthcoming [AmstradGameDevChallenge](https://github.com/AmstradGameDevChallenge/), but meanwhile, a lot of work remains!
